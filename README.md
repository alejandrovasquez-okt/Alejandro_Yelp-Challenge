# Alejandro_Yelp-Challenge
 Repository for the Yelp Challenge.

What's in this file?

It contains the ChromeDriver used for the test and also the classes used to solve the challenge.
Very simple, it contains two separate classes: one which contains all of the methods I used for the challenge, while the other one contains all of the 3 tests recquired to complete the challenge.
It also has the pom.xlm file for the dependencies and the testng.xml file to initialize the test.
In order to initialize the test via Terminal, just need to type "mvn test" in the Terminal and push enter.
All three parameters and criteria used in each test are specified in the "Expected Results" section of Assembla and TestLodge.
